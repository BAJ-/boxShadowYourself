# boxShadowYourself
I might as well be clear about this from the beginning; this is a silly thing to do. After reading in the box-shadow specs that you can add an arbitrary number of box-shadow's I thought to my self; that sounds like a challenge. Hence I wrote this little tool that lets you convert an image into its box-shadow representation.

Try it for yourself [here](http://baj-.github.io/boxShadowYourself/src/).
